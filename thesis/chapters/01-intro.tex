\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Abstract}
Short introduction to a problem and proposed solution. ERA5 

\section{Motivation}
Emphasize the exponential growth of data worldwide and comparison of NWP and MLP approaches (pros and cons, supercomputers for NWP etc.) with the suggestion that machine learning methods are especially promising for future research and development.

\section{Goals}
Obtain sufficient results that allows to confirm thesis that Graph Neural Networks and generally machine learning approaches for weather prediction task is promising and worth developing.

\section{Scope}

\subsection{Models}
Survey multiple machine learning models and a lighter version of GraphCast architecture. Perform experiments, compare results with ground truth weather states dataset ERA5 and SOTA/topline solution based on fluid dynamics or other related to Numerical Weather Prediction approach.

\subsection{App}
Create a robust and reliable application with API that communicate with our best model.

\section{Methodology}
Definition of Agile and description of launched habits e.g. our live-coding and brain-storming sessions.
